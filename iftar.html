    <h2>
    The blessed month of Ramadan is the best month ever.
 God Almighty has allocated this month with many benefits,
 and has doubled the rewards.
 He cast his love into the hearts of his servants.
 Muslims in all parts of the earth rejoice at the arrival of this great month.
They prepare to receive it in various ways and means,
and they rejoice in living in its shadow,
as fasting during Ramadan is one of the pillars of Islam.
 It is obligatory on Muslims. 
The month of Ramadan is called the month of the Qur’an. 
In it, it was revealed to our honorable Messenger Muhammad -
 may God bless him and grant him peace.
 He used to study it with Gabriel - peace be upon him -
  during the blessed nights of Ramadan,
 and it is also called the month of resurrection,
  because this worship is abundant in it.
